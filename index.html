    <h1>AI as Co-Constructor</h1>

    <p>How should we approach creative collaboration with AI?

<p>how well does vibe coding actually work?

<p>what’s hard about traditional programming: 
complexity that limits the scope of the piece you can control
hidden technical steps that you do not have control over
capabilities that exist, but are opaque; you don’t know if you don’t know
the gap between your intention and the instructions you actually wrote; people frequently miss or rearrange steps, forget to cover edge cases

<p>what’s powerful about traditional programming: 
once you get it working, it can work for you thousands more times, or for thousands of other people
a sense of magic in taking your intentions and plans, and carrying them out faithfully
the ability of computers to calculate fast can be put to whatever use you want
when there are gaps between intention and result, you can slow down and inspect and step through to resolve this gap


<p>what’s hard about vibe coding: 
the gap between your intention and the prompt you actually wrote
gap between functionality that would fit the prompt, and the code that was generated. narrower gap in some ways because it won’t, say, miss an edge case, but can be unknowably wide
inability to make steady, incremental progress on resolving gaps; difficult to inspect
when you hit technical limits (CORS, need for persistent data store, inability for some model to incorporate outside resource URLs), the models do not understand their own limits and when to stop attempting to fix the problem, and start explaining how you will need to transcend the model
LLMs are highly path-dependent; you can reach a poor local maximum, and have no way to make progress but to backtrack or start over. This requires human judgment to recognize.

<p>what’s powerful about vibe coding: 
ability to create something usable quickly
conversational model; easier to react to examples with critical feedback, than to design something from scratch
ability to leverage the internet’s collective technical knowledge
capabilities that you don’t know about can be made available to you; ability to be surprised, to brainstorm, to draw on domain knowledge


<p>theses:
understanding AI model limits is crucial to using them well
effective explorations using AI are nonlinear
novice users don’t realize how much of what they imagine is missing from their prompts; need practice making understandings explicit
LLM use for projects involves multiple LLMs and context sessions; maintaining and recreating context is key
we need language for distilled, LLM-assisted context summaries, and need to build tools for editing these manually
there is a major gap between the predictive structure of LLMs, and the way humans think in terms of immediate priorities. Many students yearn for “something stronger than all caps” to get an LLM to deeply reassess some assumption.

<p>examples from my projects:

<p>this way of life – i have full prompt history, versions. what’s interesting?
need to urge it to rewrite elements
serendipitous elements; so much that is part of the later version is the creative invention of the LLM
but, it didn’t take my cue to produce more branches than I described
incoherence: meters are often meaningless
internal understanding shows in its handoffs; but that is currently not exposed. room for more of a proactive approach?
